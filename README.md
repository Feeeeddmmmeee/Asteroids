# Asteroids

Asteroids is a space-themed arcade shooter game originally created by Atari, Inc. and realeased in 1979. I attempted to recreated the game using C++ and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)

## Compiling
To compile and run the game on Windows you'll need to first install [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), [SDL_Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) and proper C++ support.
